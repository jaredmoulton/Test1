Repository for Spark (Particle) email to SMS project

2021 update - This was basically my first ever programming project and what I was trying to do whas send an email from a spark (particle) wifi board to my phone number when an event was triggered such as a motion sensor and have it show up as a text. It worked... and it was pure luck. I copied all the code from an online forum and then just cahnged values and messed with things until... it worked. I had 0 undersatnding of C at the time.
